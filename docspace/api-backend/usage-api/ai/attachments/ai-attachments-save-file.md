# aiAttachmentsSaveFile

> AiAttachment aiAttachmentsSaveFile(AiAttachmentsSaveFileRequest)

`POST /api/2.0/ai/attachments/save-file`

Save file

Stores one file attachment as a draft and returns it, so its ID can be attached to a message later. `input` carries the host `path` - the DocSpace entry ID the AI backend resolves server-side - the text `content` already extracted from that file, the ONLYOFFICE numeric file `type`, and optionally a `title`; the text is what the model reads, so this operation does not open the file itself. Archives are refused outright, whatever their declared name says. Drafts are not bound to a conversation until `POST api/2.0/ai/attachments/link-to-message` is called, so an unlinked draft outlives the round that created it.
